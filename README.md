# jamJarLid
This game was developed at the Waterloo Games Institute Fall 2022 Game Jam. The goal of the game is to find the lid for your jar (you!), avoiding common kitchen obstacles such as knives, and falling from large heights. 
The models were created in Blender and the game was developed in Unity.
